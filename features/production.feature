Feature: Production
    More realistic calculations. Many of the test cases have displayed problems with different compilations of VASP.

    Scenario: MgMoS
        Given that the POTCAR MD5 is b2b680bb74dbd3d9ba691a82343c4a95
        When I run VASP with a maximum of 16 ranks
        Then the total energy should be -114.896037 +/- 1.0e-5 eV
            and self consistency should be reached in 15 iterations
            and the pressure should be -13.09 +/- 1.0 kB
            and the point group symmetry should be C_1
            and the XML output should be valid

    @gamma
    Scenario: SO3
        Given that the POTCAR MD5 is 4823c0c64273f99ca3a80cb37ea000eb
        When I run VASP with a maximum of 16 ranks
        Then the total energy should be -22.934924 +/- 1.0e-5 eV
            and self consistency should be reached in 21 iterations
            and the XML output should be valid

        Then the total energy should be -63.17282850 +/- 1.0e-5 eV
            and self consistency should be reached in 14 iterations
            and the pressure should be 63.11 +/- 5.0 kB

        When I run VASP with a maximum of 128 ranks
        Then the total energy should be -850.262131 +/- 2.0e-4 eV
            and self consistency should be reached in 31 iterations
            and the pressure should be -2.65 +/- 0.2 kB
